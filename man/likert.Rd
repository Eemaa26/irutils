\title{Constructor function to create a likert class.}
\usage{
  likert(items, grouping = NULL,
    nlevels = length(levels(items[, 1])))
}
\arguments{
  \item{items}{data frame containing the likert based
  items. The variables in the data frame should be
  factors.}

  \item{grouping}{(optional) should the results be
  summarized by the given grouping variable.}

  \item{nlevels}{number of possible levels. Only necessary
  if there are missing levels.}
}
\value{
  a likert class with the following elements: results,
  items, grouping, nlevels, and summary.
}
\description{
  This function will provide various summary statistics
  about a set of likert items. The resulting object will
  have the following items: \itemize{ \item results this
  data frame will contain a column 'Item', 'Group' (if a
  grouping variable was specified, and a column for each
  level of the items (e.g. agree, disagree, etc.). The
  value within each cell corresponds to the percentage of
  responses for that level and group.  \item items a copy
  of the original items data frame.  \item grouping a copy
  of the original grouping vector.  \item nlevels the
  number of levels used in the calculations.  \item summary
  this data frame provides additional summary information.
  It will contain 'Item' and 'Group' columns similiar to
  the results data frame as well as a column 'low'
  corresponding to the sum of levels below neutral, a
  column 'high' corresponding to the sum of levels above
  neutral, and columns 'mean' and 'sd' corresponding to the
  mean and standard deviation, respectively, of the
  results. The numeric values are determined by as.numeric
  which will use the values of the factors. }
